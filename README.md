CENTIPEDE
=========

Centipede is (going to be) a set of my terribly abusive experiments with
parallel programming technologies. It may become a useful library at some point,
but more likely, it will just be a set of benchmarks and abandoned ideas. I am
sure I will learn a hell of a lot either way.
